## Features üåü  

### **Core Functionalities** üõ†Ô∏è  
- **Data Collection**: Fetches historical stock data using `yfinance`.  
- **Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, removes outliers, and calculates technical indicators (e.g., SMA, RSI, MACD).  
- **Visualization**: Generates insightful plots for price trends, volume analysis, RSI, MACD, and returns distribution.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and Transformer-based models for stock price prediction.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Adds advanced features like volatility, price momentum, RSI changes, and MACD histogram.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC for model performance comparison.

## Project Workflow üîç  

1. **Data Collection**: Download three years of stock market data using `yfinance`.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean data by handling missing values and outliers using IQR methods.  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Add technical indicators like SMA (Simple Moving Average), RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and daily returns.  
4. **Visualization**: Create plots for price trends with moving averages, RSI analysis, returns distribution, and trading volume over time.  
5. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost, LSTM-based neural networks, CNN-LSTM hybrids, and Transformer-based architectures for predictive analytics. Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC scores.

## Visualizations üìä  

The project includes detailed visualizations such as:  
- Stock price trends with moving averages (SMA).  
- RSI analysis with overbought/oversold thresholds (70/30).  
- MACD analysis with signal lines for trend identification.  
- Distribution of daily returns to understand volatility.
